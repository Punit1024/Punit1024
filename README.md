## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So nice to see you here,

I am a Robotics engineer and like learning new things.  

Next things I wanna learn ðŸŒ± is machine learning and neural network, and to use it in some controls application, possibly using for modeling of actuators.


ðŸ’¬ Talk me about -> Interesting Algorithms, Innovative Actuators, Arduino, ESP32, 3d-Printing and more... 





Here are some interesting projects I have worked on ---

Have you ever struggled with multiple people approaching you for help with various tasks, only to find that, once they're done, you've completely lost track of what you were originally doing? Sometimes, something else captures your attention, and you end up working on that instead of the task you had planned to finish today. This happens to me a lot. I thought, wouldnâ€™t it be great to have my active task always visible, serving as a reminder and pulling me back to focus? Thatâ€™s why I created this project.

This project uses an ESP32, a 16x4 LCD screen, and 4 buttons. It fetches your tasks from Todoist.com and displays only one task at a time, with options to close the task, go to the next or previous one, and a back button to return to the list of projects. You can keep this on your desk, and it will continually display your active task to keep you on track.

Simulate a home service robot that can map, localize, and navigate to transport objects, moving from one room to another autonomously.

I have been recently fascinated by one and two propeller drone and have seen some great implementation out there for counter balancing the inertia and maneuvering the drone. I had few ideas of my own, and needed a safe way to validate those concepts. This project allows me to apply an controls algorithm to the motor and concept  actuators and see results if I can generate directional forces that would help in steering the drone.

Simulation inside Gazebo of robot that performs Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

#### :point_right: [Modeling Simulation and optimization of trebuchet](https://github.com/Punit1024/Advanced_Dynamics)
this project contrains modeling approach and simulation of a Trebuchet inside mathematica and adds various visualization to see imapact of different parameters.

#### :point_right: [Various Vehicle Dynamics projects ](https://github.com/Punit1024/Electric-Vehicle-modeling-and-simulation)
- Modeling of 3-Phase PMSM with Vector Controls
- 4 DOF Vehicle Dynamics Model
- EV Range estimation
